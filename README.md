## Mission Statement

Facilitating access to the world's most beautiful beaches for Seattleites.

## Problem

Cheri Allen has not been to a quiet beach with crystal blue water, white sand, and palm trees in too long. Lack of tropical beach access can cause psychological distress and acute physical damage from vitamin D deficiency.
